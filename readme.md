### Functionality
This relates to my version of the app: [WEB-Drawing-App](https://filkovsp.github.io/WEB-Drawing-App).
1. Choose a shape. Colour will be set to black by default.
2. Draw a shape by clicking once on the canvas, then move mouse and watch how shape's sketch chages its size. Make second click when you're satisfied with the size and place. This is called modelling process. If you decide to cancell modelling and pick different shape or shange its colour - press ESC key while modelling. The make necessary changes.
3. When shape is placed on the canvas use Mouse scroll Up/Down to Zoom In/Out.
3. To drag the whole picture over the canvas press middle mous button, hold it and move mouse to the place where you want. Relase the middle mouse button to set the new place for the drawing at the canvas.
